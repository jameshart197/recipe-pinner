# Testing

# Deployment
## Steps to deploy site using Heroku:
- Assuming gunicorn, dj_database_url, psycopg2 and dj3-cloudinary-storage have been installed
- On the Heroku dashboard, select "New" and click "Create new app"
  - Create a unique app name - this will be added to allowed hosts in the project settings
  - Select your region
  - Click "Create app"
- Go to the Resources tab:
  - Search for "postgres" in the add-ons search bar and select "Heroku Postgres"
  - Click "Submit Order Form"
- Go to the settings tab:
  - Scroll down to the config vars section and select "Reveal Config Vars"
  - DATABASE_URL will be set after adding Heroku Postgres - this will be copied to the project
  - Add a new config var for SECRET_KEY - create your own or use a django secret key generator
  - Add a new config var for CLOUDINARY_URL - copy the "API Environment variable" from your cloudinary dashboard, remove "CLOUDINARY_URL="
  - Add a new config var for DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC, with the value 1 - this will be removed before deployment
- In your project, for your environment variables:
  - Create a new env.py file in the top level directory
  - In env.py:
    - Import os
    - Add 'os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste the DATABASE_URL from the Heroku app here"'
    - Add 'os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Paste your new secret key here"'
    - Add 'os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "Paste your CLOUDINARY_URL as in the Heroku app here"'
  ```
  import os

  os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'postgres://exampledatabaseurl'
  os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'examplesecretkey'
  os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = 'cloudinary://examplecloudinaryurl'
  ```
  - If not already present, create a .gitignore file and add env.py to it

- In your project, in settings.py:
  - Import os
  - Import dj_database_url
  - if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
	import env
  ```
  import os
  import dj_database_url
  if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
      import env
  ```
  - Replace the insecure secret key with "SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')"
  ```
  SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
  ```
  - Link new database by commenting out old DATABASES section and adding:
	DATABASES = {
			'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
			}
  ```
  DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
  ```
  - Add Heroku to the allowed hosts: "ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['the_app_name_from_heroku.herokuapp.com']
  ```
  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example-heroku-app-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
  ```
  - Add 'cloudinary_storage' (above 'django.contrib.staticfiles') and 'cloudinary' (below) to INSTALLED_APPS
  ```
  ...
  'cloudinary_storage',
  'django.contrib.staticfiles',
  'cloudinary',
  ...
  ```
  - Setup Cloudinary to store static and media files
  ```
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
	STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
	STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
	STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

	MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
	DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
  ```
  - Run 'python3 manage.py collectstatic' to collect static files
- In your project:
  - Create a Procfile in the top level directory and add 'web: gunicorn project_name.wsgi' to tell 
  ```
  web: gunicorn project_name.wsgi
  ```
  - Create a requirements file with 'pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt' for Heroku to install required packages
  ```
  pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
  ```
  - Make migrations with 'python3 manage.py migrate'
  ```
  python3 manage.py migrate
  ```
  - Commit and push to GitHub
- Prior to final deployment:
  - Set DEBUG = False in project settings.py
  - Remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var from Heroku
- Go to the Deploy tab:
  - Select GitHub and confirm connection to GitHub account
  - Search for the repository and click "Connect"
  - Scroll down to the deploy options
  - Select automatic deploys if you would like automatic deployment with each new push to the GitHub repository
  - In manual deploy, select which branch to deploy and click "Deploy Branch"
  - Heroku will start building the app
- The link to the app can be found at the top of the page by clicking "Open app"
